            Bicol Express is basically a type of pork stew which is specifically made to be creamy and spicy at the same time. This creaminess and spiciness is achieved by adding coconut milk (gata), shrimp paste (bagoong alamang), and lots of chilies to the stew.</p>

            It is made for the people who want a pork stew which is spicy, but also want to balance it out with mild sweetness. And this is the result of that. With the right combination, it is definitely something Filipinos are hardly able to resist.

                <h2>Steps:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pour the cooking oil in a cooking pot and apply medium heat.
                    </li>
                    <li>When the oil is hot enough, add-in the garlic and onion and saute.
                    </li>
                    <li>When limp and aromatic, add-in the pork meat slices.
                    </li>
                    <li>Cook for 5 to 7 minutes or until light brown.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add-in the bagoong alamang. Make sure to do a taste test before adding this. If it is too salty for you, try washing with water to reduce the saltiness.
                    </li>
                    <li>Pour in the coconut milk. Make sure all the meat is covered with coconut milk. If not, add more coconut milk or water.
                    </li>
                    <li>Bring to a boil and cover the pot. Cook for about 30-40 minutes or until the meat is tender.
                    </li>
                    <li>Remove the cover and let the remaining coconut milk evaporate.
                    </li>
                    <li>Pour in the coconut cream, add-in the chilis (siling haba and siling labuyo) and the black pepper.
                    </li>
                    <li>Continue to simmer, uncovered, while stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens and the meat begins to render fat.
                    </li>
                    <li>Remove from heat and transfer to a serving plate. Enjoy!
                    </li>
